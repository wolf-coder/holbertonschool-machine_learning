    Function that performs the forward algorithm for a hidden markov model:

    Observation is a numpy.ndarray of shape (T,) that contains
the index of the observation
        T is the number of observations
    Emission is a numpy.ndarray of shape (N, M) containing the
emission probability of a specific observation given a hidden state
        Emission[i, j] is the probability of observing j given the
hidden state i
        N is the number of hidden states
        M is the number of all possible observations
    Transition is a 2D numpy.ndarray of shape (N, N) containing
the transition probabilities
        Transition[i, j] is the probability of transitioning
from the hidden state i to j
    Initial a numpy.ndarray of shape (N, 1) containing the probability
of starting in a particular hidden state
    Returns: P, F, or None, None on failure
        P is the likelihood of the observations given the model
        F is a numpy.ndarray of shape (N, T) containing the forward
path probabilities
        F[i, j] is the probability of being in hidden state i at time
j given the previous observations
